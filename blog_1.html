              <h4>I am barely five-foot-two with a zero ape index and my height often feels like the biggest limiting factor to my climbing ability.</h4>
              <p>I could easily use my height as an excuse for why I can't do a specific move (and I very often do), but rationally speaking, my height has also played as my biggest strength. There have been times where a move was simply impossible for me because my span was too small. However, there have been other times where I was able to pull a move much easier than a taller climber because I could fit in the small box better or get my foot up freakishly high. Many climbing moves actually feel more comfortable if you are shorter, such as hand-foot matches, small crimps, and mini compression. So hey, it's not so bad down here.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>There have been moments where a boulder problem absolutely infuriated me.</h4>
              <p>The moves felt crazy extended and difficult, and I'm not going to lie, seeing taller climbers cruise the section I was struggling with was slightly disheartening. Why is life so unfair (Okay, maybe a little melodramatic)? Despite how frustrated I get, I try my best not to give up on a boulder problem just because I think it would be easier if I were longer. Ultimately, my height is not something that is in my control (the growth spurt ship sailed long ago) so instead of dwelling on my lack of reach, I try to look at the problem as a way to challenge a weakness, improve my power, and exercise my creativity. Boulders (especially when we are speaking outdoors) are usually climbable in a multitude of ways. If you try hard enough, I guarantee you can rack up a long list of different ways you could do a specific move or sequence of moves and remember, there's nothing wrong with breaking beta! As a short climber, you will often have to break beta to get through a section of a boulder and get pretty creative with your beta reads. I've had to match holds that were definitely not meant to be matched, and hand-heel matches have become my best friend. I've also become very comfortable with cutting feet. During a climbing session, you will probably catch me jumping from one shitty crimp to another pretty much constantly. So trust me on this: if you write off a boulder just because you think it's “too reachy”, you are missing out on many learning opportunities!</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Working out beta requires patience, especially when a move/problem is at your limit.</h4>
              <p>Sometimes, a move may seem unfathomable at the beginning. However, as you keep working the move, you may notice yourself getting closer and closer to sticking it, and that right there is the art of projecting. It's very normal to see climbers spend many sessions, even seasons projecting just one climb. Take Emma Twyman for example, a climber and routesetter from the UK. She started trying The Big Bang (9a) back in 2016 and sent the climb three years later in 2019. Martin Keller, a climber and coach from Switzerland, spent 150 sessions working Ninja Skills SSD V14/15 before he sent. This is what can happen when you devote time, energy, and close attention to a project. And just picture the feeling of accomplishment and euphoria that would come with overcoming such a challenge.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>I've been a bit of a <a href="https://www.moonboard.com/what-is-the-moonboard" target="_blank">Moonboard</a> addict for over 3 years.</h4>
              <p>It's hard to pinpoint what it is about Moonboarding I find so appealing. The Moonboard has a it's own unique style: dynamic, powerful, and finger-intensive. It can be incredibly fun at times, and utterly demoralizing other times. When I first started Moonboarding, my fingers would ache for days following a single session. The knuckles on my fingers felt so sore that simply knocking on a door was painful. Despite the aches and pains, I was still having a ton of fun. I especially loved how the app easily let you track your progress as there were stats, benchmarks, a logbook, and a ranking system. Another perk to board climbs is the climbs essentially stay there forever, there is no time constraint to send a problem as there is with climbs in the gym. Despite the fact that the Moonboard is small and you are limited to one angle, you can still come up with some very interesting and complex moves. Additionally, the benchmarks up on the app are nails. As I've been working through the benchmarks, I've come across many problems that feel completely out of reach. Maybe they simply feel impossible now because I'm not quite strong enough to pull off those big and powerful moves. And it's totally possible that I have a completely different experience on those same moves when I try them in a year's time. That being said, it's important to remember that one climb is not a determinant of your climbing ability. As they say, "you can't win 'em all". However, it is still important to mark the difference between a climb where you are <i>truly</i> limited by your reach, and one that just requires you to get a little better at climbing in order to complete. I often get down on myself when a jug haul with humongous moves and a low grade seems unfeasible for someone my size. In these moments, I try to remind myself that although this style may inherently be harder for me due to my morphology, that shouldn't deter me from trying the climb anyways. Also, grades are kind of meaningless.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Almost everybody is going to climb a boulder differently.</h4>
              <p>Comparing yourself to other climbers, especially when it's in a negative or self-deprecating way is not going to be a productive use of your precious time and energy. Instead, focus on yourself and what you can immediately control. Ask yourself what could you tweak about the way your positioning your body? What are some alternate ways you can try a particular move? Maybe you could change the way you are gripping the hold? Maybe you could adjust your foot placement by a centimeter? Climbing is first and foremost a technical sport and being a great climber is not at all synonymous with being tall (e.g. Brooke Raboutou, Jain Kim, Ashima Shiraishi, etc). A technical climber is one that understands flow and how to be relaxed in uncomfortable positions. They grip each hold and place each foot with utmost intention and precision. They are able to accurately determine what a climb is asking them to do (the beta) and then executing those moves with a healthy balance of power and elegance.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>A short climber's greatest strength should probably be strength.</h4>
              <p>Being smaller naturally means most moves are bigger and more powerful for you in comparison to the average-sized climber, especially when most setting teams are largely comprised of taller folks. A lot of people seem to hate strength training due to its repetitive and monotonous nature. To that regard I say: you are likely blindly following a plan or protocol that is not working for you. What a lot of people don't understand is that creating a training routine is not one-size-fits-all. Training is a long-term process that requires trial and error and tuning with your body to see how it is responding to the physical stimuli. The training you do outside of climbing also does not need to take up a lot of your time. A little bit of training can take you a long way towards improvement (1 to 2x a week, 30 minutes to an hour). You should look for exercises that are enjoyable to you. There is an endless list of exercises out there to try out so don't feel confined to a style of training you really dislike (me with endurance-oriented training and floor core - barf). A note on difficulty whilst training, if you feel a lot of pain and discomfort, and you are really struggling to get through the reps, that may be a sign you should likely reduce the difficulty (reducing the reps, volume, weights, etc). Doing so will likely make training less grueling and energy-sapping. A few exercises I’ve found to be very valuable and enjoyable are weighted pull ups, lock offs, and lots of core (front lever progression exercises especially).</p>
              <br>
              <h4>I've learned that our greatest weakness can simultaneously be our greatest strength. That is definitely true when it comes to being a short climber.</h4>
              <p> Although there is value in watching and learning from other climbers with different body types, it's vital that you take the time to learn your body, home into your own climbing style, and discover your strengths and your weaknesses. Don't be afraid to get wildly creative with beta, because sometimes the weirdest ideas end up being the best ones. Finally, be patient, trust the process, and never stop trying hard.</p>
